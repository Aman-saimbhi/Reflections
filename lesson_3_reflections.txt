1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repository is useful when we want to make our repository public to everyone
    it is useful when there are number of people working on the same project
    and everyone needs to push their changes in the main version.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    we might want to pull the changes in the repository , because maybe i am working on
    some different thing and for any reason i dont want the commit which is pushed
    by some another person in my repository in these types of cases
    manual pull is required.
